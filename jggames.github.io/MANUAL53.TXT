                           WHAT IS Logical Theorist 5.3? 
 
          The purpose of this "theorem machine" is to provide an 
          environment for the easy and accurate development of logical 
          systems along the lines of those presented in "Principia 
          Mathematica."  It achieves this end by allowing only legal logical 
          operations to be performed.  Because the computer does the mundane 
          work of checking and creating new lines, mistakes that often 
          result from misreading, mistyping, or inaccurate 
          transcription of lines, can be avoided.  With the high degree of 
          symbolization involved in formal logic systems it is easy to 
          introduce errors and to mistakenly derive formulas that are 
          invalid.  By letting the computer do the work one can escape the 
          all to common "optical errors" and concentrate on the creative 
          work of trying to reach new theorems without fear of syntactic 
          mistake.

                          STARTING UP Logical Theorist 5.3 
 
          1.   Insert the disk into the drive of your choice.  If you have 
               copied Logic Theorist 5.3 (LOGIC53.EXE) to a hard drive then 
               change the path to the sub-directory where you have located 
               the program. 
 
          2.   Type: 
                    <logic53> <Start up file> <background colour> 
          <foreground colour> 
 
               Example: 
                    LOGIC53 TEST.DAT 7 0 
 
               and press ENTER or RETURN. 
 
          3.   After a few seconds the title screen will appear.  It will 
               remain on the screen for several seconds and then the 
               start-up message will appear 
 
               Do you want to create a new system? (y/n) 
 
               If you wish to start the process of entering axioms in order 
               to create your own logical system type: 
                                             <y> 
               This will put you into the axiom entering mode described in 
               the Edit Menu section of this manual. 
 
               Otherwise type: 
                                             <n> 
 
               This will allow you to specify a file of lines for loading 
               which has been previously created and saved.

                           HOW TO USE Logical Theorist 5.3 
 
          ENTERING AXIOMS 
 
               The first step in the development of any axiomatic logical 
          system, such as the one presented by Alfred North Whitehead and 
          Bertrand Russell, involves the entry of a few base axioms from 
          which the rest of the system is derived.  One can use the same 
          basic axioms of Principia Mathematica in the Logical Theorist 5.3 
          program but one is free to choose any axioms that conform to the 
          basic rules of modern symbolic logic and the rules of consistent 
          bracketing and proper variables as outlined in this manual.  You 
          can begin entering axioms as soon as you start Logical Theorist 
          5.3 by simply answering <y> to the "...new system (y/n)" prompt, 
          or at other time by going to the Edit Menu and choosing <F8> for 
          the Axiom function. 
 
          VARIABLES 
 
               As the old adage goes with Ford Model T's one can choose to 
          use any variables one likes as long as they are single lowercase 
          letters or a combination of a lowercase letter and one of five 
          available Greek letters.  Uppercase variables can also be used 
          but are treated as constants that cannot be substituted for by 
          other variables.  Two exceptions are the lower case "v" and the 
          upper case "E" which are reserved for the program's use.  The 
          first is used to represent the traditional conjunctive "or," which 
          normally takes the form of a wedge.  The second is used as the 
          symbol for the existential quantifier for existence, which is 
          traditionally represented by a backwards "E".   
 
          BRACKETING 
 
               Another protocol adhered to by the program is consistent 
          bracketing.  In developing systems by hand on paper it is easy to 
          leave out brackets that are unnecessary for comprehension.  It 
          is also the practice of many logicians to use different forms of 
          brackets in order to make theorems easier to read.  These 
          distinctions only confuse the computer so only curved "()"
          brackets are used within the program.  Although it makes the 
          lines a little harder to read, it is much simpler to write a 
          program using a consistent approach for the bracketing of 
          formulas.  This is unfortunate and may be revised in future 
          versions of the program, but as of yet, I have not determined any 
          consistent form of bracketing that would serve both human and 
          computer needs. 
               The most important aspect of bracketing is the program's 
          requirement that all lines be surrounded by a pair of brackets 
          that enclose the theorem as a whole.  While this is not necessary 
          for our own comprehension of a line it makes the computer's task 
          of breaking down a line into its component parts much simpler.

          WELL FORMED FORMULAS 
 
               A well formed formula is any valid logical expression.  Some 
          examples of valid well formed formulas are: 
               (p>p) 
               ~P 
               ~~q 
               ((~pvq)>(~qvp)) 
               (Ex)Tx 
               ~(x)~Tx 
          Notice that single variables count as well formed formulas (WFFs) 
          and require no outside brackets.  Complex well formed formulas, 
          such as (p>p), require outside brackets. 
 
 
          BLOCKING AND HIGHLIGHTING
 
               Blocking [Ctrl-B] is the procedure of highlighting a line or
          part of a line in order to perform some function or logical
          operation on it. In carrying out blocking, one must usually follow
          the guidelines that apply to bracketing of well formed formulas.
 
 
          MENUS
 
               Logical Theorist 5.3 is a menu driven program.  This means that
          all of its main functions are available to you through a hierarchy
          of different menus bars that appear at the bottom of the 
          screen.  These menu bars give you a list of functions which can 
          be performed by pressing one of the function or "F" keys 
          available on all IBM compatible computers.  Since the menu system 
          is hierarchical, from the Main Menu bar one can press keys that
          makes one of three sub menus available until <ESC> is pressed.
          For example, from the Main Menu bar one can select a range
          of file operations by pressing <F10>.  This new menu bar allows
          the function keys to perform a different set of functions, which
          will remain available, and listed at the bottom of the screen,
          until you move to another sub menu or press <ESC> to return to the
          Main Menu.
 

          The ESC key 
 
               In the program the <ESC> key performs three basic functions. 
          It will take you back to the Main Menu from any of the sub menus.  
          Pressing <ESC> at the Main Menu will allow you to exit the 
          program.  Finally, it will abort activated functions that have 
          been selected from the various menu bars or through control key 
          combinations.

                                   CURSOR CONTROL 
 
 
               The following is a list of the cursor movement keys and 
          what they do: 
 
 
          Right Arrow    Moves the cursor one character to the right. 
 
          Left Arrow     Moves the cursor one character to the left. 
 
          Up Arrow       Moves the cursor one line up. 
 
          Down Arrow     Moves the cursor one line up. 
 
          Pg Up          If the cursor is not located on the top line of 
                         the lines screen pressing this key will move the 
                         cursor to the top line of the screen.  Otherwise 
                         it moves the cursor up by 10 lines. 
 
          Pg Dn          If the cursor is not located on the bottom line of 
                         the lines screen pressing this key will move the 
                         cursor to the bottom line of the screen.  
                         Otherwise it moves the cursor down by 10 lines. 
 
          Ctrl-Pg Up     If the cursor is not located on the top line of 
                         the lines screen pressing this key will move the 
                         cursor to the top line of the screen.  Otherwise 
                         it moves the cursor up by 100 lines. 
 
          Ctrl-Pg Dn     If the cursor is not located on the bottom line of 
                         the lines screen pressing this key will move the 
                         cursor to the bottom line of the screen.  
                         Otherwise it moves the cursor down by 100 lines. 
 
          Home           Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. 
 
          End            Moves the cursor right by 60 characters. 
 
          Ctrl-Home      If the cursor is not located on the top line of 
                         the lines screen pressing this key will move the 
                         cursor to the top line of the screen.  Otherwise 
                         it moves the cursor to the first line of the 
                         system.

                              complete well formed formulas. 
 
          Ctrl-Left Arrow     Moves the cursor to the next left bracket. 
 

          ERRORS 
 
               Throughout the program the strategy that applies to the creation
          of new lines is to alert the user to mistakes.  If one attempts to
          perform a legitimate function on a line then the computer will
          prompt you to generate the new line along with its appropriate
          justification.  If an illegitimate function is requested an error
          message will be displayed explaining why that function could not be
          performed.  You will be prompted to acknowledge the message.  Unlike
          previous versions of the program, Logical Theorist 5.3 does not beep
          when it encounters errors. 
 
 
          ERROR CODES 
 
               Logical Theorist 5.3 will notify you whenever an error is  
          encountered.  These errors fall under two different categories: 
 
          1 - If they are errors to do with the proper application of logic, 
          such as improper bracketing, you should be able to correct your
          mistake and continue.  In most cases the error will be displayed in
          the work area along with the message "PRESS ENTER TO CONTINUE" in 
          the menu bar.  Pressing <ENTER> will clear the error message and 
          allow you to continue working with the system.  Sometimes additional
          error messages will be displayed.  You will need to acknowledge these
          messages as well.  Sometimes an error message might occur when you 
          attempt to perform what appears to be a perfectly legal operation.
          This might occur because the line lies within the confines of a
          conditional proof.  See the CPon and CPoff functions for more 
          information about the restrictions surrounding conditional proofs. 
             
          2 - The other kinds of errors you might encounter involve an 
          actual flaw in the program.  These kinds of errors might 
          display a specific message and will sometimes "lock up" the 
          computer.  If you should encounter one of these kinds of errors 
          please contact the programmer and outline what you were doing at 
          the time the error occurred.

          THE SCREEN 
 
               Logical Theorist 5.3 divides the computer's screen into 
          five areas: 
 
               1 -  The Lines Screen 
               2 -  The Proof (or Justifications) Screen 
               3 -  The Work Area (located just below the line and 
                    Proof screens) 
               4 -  The Help Area (located just above the Menu Bar) 
               5 -  The Menu Bar (located at the bottom of the screen) 
 
          The Lines Screen is where the lines (formulas) of your system 
          are displayed.  The Work Area is where any line you highlight 
          using the block function is displayed.  It is also where the 
          various functions of the program are performed.  The Help Area 
          displays useful information on how to run the program.  It will 
          also indicate which menu level you currently are in.  The Menu 
          Bar lists the current functions of the function keys.

          Rule 1 
          Rule One 
 
          This is the rule commonly called Modus Ponens.  To perform this 
          function you need to work with two lines.  The first of these 
          lines is the major premise the second is the minor premise.  In 
          carrying out this function you must first select the minor premise
          by marking it using the block function.  Then you must move the
          cursor to the line containing the major premise and press <F4> to
          generate the conclusion.  If you have properly marked the minor 
          premise and have made a valid choice of lines you will be notified
          that a new line has been created.  Otherwise you will be notified
          of an error.  See ERROR CODES. 
 
          Rule 2 
          Rule Two 
 
          To perform this function first move the cursor to the line to which 
          you wish to make substitutions.  You will then be prompted, variable
          by variable, for the well formed formulas you wish to substitute.
          Type in the desired WFF or move the cursor to another line and block
          off a section of the formula for use as a WFF for substitution. Once 
          you have entered or blocked a WFF simply press <ENTER>.  If you wish 
          to make no substitution for a specific variable, press <ENTER> or 
          <RETURN> to skip over it.  If your substitutions are valid a new 
          line will be created, otherwise you will be notified with an 
          error message. 

 
          DR 1 
          Derived Rule One 
 
          This is the rule commonly called Hypothetical Syllogism.  Before 
          this function can be used you must have generated within your 
          system lines of either of the following forms: 
 
               ((p>q)>((r>p)>(r>q))) 
 
               ((p>q)>((q>r)>(p>r))) 
 
          It is not necessary that the variables be the same as long as the 
          form is the same.  To perform this function you need to work with 
          two lines.  The first of these lines is the major premise the 
          second is the minor premise.  In carrying out the option you must 
          Highlight the line which is to be the minor premise and then move 
          the cursor to the major premise line.  Once you have the cursor 
          located on the line of the major premise press <F6> to generate 
          the conclusion.  If you have properly blocked and have made a 
          valid choice of lines you will be notified that a series of new 
          lines are being created.  Otherwise you will be notified of an 
          error.  See ERROR CODES.

          DR 2 
          Derived Rule Two 
 
          This is the rule commonly called conjunction.  Before this 
          function can be used you must have generated in your system a 
          line of the following form: 
 
               (p>(q>(p+q))) 
 
          It is not necessary that the variables be the same as long as the 
          form is the same.  To perform this function you need to work with 
          two lines.  The first of these lines is the major premise the 
          second is the minor premise.  In carrying out the option you must 
          highlight the minor premise and then move the cursor to the major 
          premise.  Once you have the cursor located on the line of the 
          major premise press <F7> to generate the conclusion.  If you have 
          properly blocked and have made a valid choice of lines you will 
          be notified that a series of new lines are being created.  
          Otherwise you will be notified of an error.  See ERROR CODES.

          This rule is needed to derive theorems for predicate logic.  It 
          is commonly called universal generalization.  To perform the 
          function move the cursor to the line which you want to 
          "universally generalize" and press <F3>.  If it is a valid line 
          for the application of this rule a new line will be created at 
          the end of the system.

          Values 
          Enter values for the interpretation of the logical symbols. 
 
          This function allows you to enter the truth values to be used 
          when interpreting the five basic logical symbols used in the 
          creation of truth tables.  The default values are as follows: 
               > 0 1    v 0 1    + 0 1    = 0 1    ~     0=False 
               0 1 1    0 0 1    0 0 0    0 1 0    0 1 
               1 0 1    1 1 1    1 0 1    1 0 1    1 0 
          Tables can be created to a maximum size of 6 elements.  When you 
          select the Values option you are first asked how many truth 
          values you would like your truth tables to contain.  Enter a 
          number or press <ENTER> to accept the displayed default.  Tables 
          for each symbol will then appear on screen.  When entering 
          the truth values for each logical symbol simply type a number and 
          hit <ENTER> to go the next position in the table for that symbol.
          If the number at the cursor position is already the number you
          desire then simply press <ENTER> to accept it as a default.  When
          you have finished entering all the values you want to change then
          complete the process by pressing <ENTER> until the cursor reaches
          the end of the tables or press <ESC> to skip through the 
          remaining tables.   

                                   IMPORTANT NOTE
          It is the value of position (0,1) of the "and" table that is used  
          to determine the preferred value for false.                  

 
          Table 
          Generate a truth table 
 
          You will be asked to select the output device for the truth table.
          Once you have entered your choice, a truth table will be 
          generated for the current line.  You may change the interpretation
          for the logical symbols by using the Values function.

          Replace
          Rule of Replacement 
 
          When using the Rule of Replacement you must use two lines.  The 
          first of these lines is the one into which you wish to make the 
          replacement.  The second line is the line which contains the 
          equivalency which is the basis of the replacement.  To perform a 
          replacement first use the Block function to highlight the Well 
          Formed Formula which is to be replaced.  Move the cursor to the 
          line which contains the equivalency which is the basis of the 
          replacement.  Then press <F5> in the Other Options menu.  If the 
          highlighted section of the first line is found on either side of 
          the equivalency in the second line a new line will be generated.  
          This new line will be the same as the first line with the 
          highlighted section replaced by the equivalent section from the 
          second line. 
  
                                   IMPORTANT NOTE 
          In order for this operation to be performed, variables from both 
          the highlighted and equivalent section must be exactly the same.  
          This may require that some substitutions be performed on the line 
          which is the basis of the equivalency. 
 

          CPon 
          Start a conditional proof 
 
          Allows for the entry of a hypothetical premise.  Conditional 
          proofs can be "nested" with up to 10 conditional proofs going on 
          at one time.  Once you have finished with your conditional proof 
          a conclusion can be drawn by using the CPoff function.  Lines 
          within the confines of a conditional proof are off limits to the 
          rest of the system.  Once a conditional proof is closed only the 
          last line of a conditional proof can be used by the system.  
          Trying to perform an operation on a line within a conditional 
          proof which has been closed will result in an error message. 
          If you enter an premise that is not a tautology you will be prompted
          to confirm that you wish to add it to your system of lines. 
 

          CPoff 
          End or "close" a conditional proof 
 
          After one has entered a hypothetical premise using the CPon 
          function and has generated the lines which are necessary for the 
          proof, this function uses the hypothetical premise and the last 
          line of the system to draw the conclusion from the conditional 
          proof.

                                   IMPORTANT NOTE 
          Once a conditional proof has been closed the lines within the 
          proof become off limits to the rest of the system.  If you 
          attempt to perform what appears to be a legal operation on a line 
          but receive an error message, check to make sure the line does 
          not lie within the confines of a conditional proof.  All 
          conditional proofs begin with lines with CP as their 
          justification and end with lines which have RCP as their 
          justification.


          Axiom 
          Enter new axioms 
 
          Selecting this option allows one to enter new axioms at any point 
          in the creation of a system.  All entered lines will be added to 
          the beginning of the system with all the following created lines 
          being renumbered to make room for the new axiom.  While this 
          option is in effect one can type in lines using the regular keys 
          as well as the function keys which will display certain symbols 
          needed in doing symbolic logic.  These symbols are listed on the 
          menu bar at the bottom of the screen.  When you have finished 
          entering the line you must press <ENTER>.  You will then be prompted
          to enter another axiom.  If you do not wish to enter more axioms then
          press <ENTER> before typing anything or press <ESC> at any time to abort.
          If you enter an axiom that is not a tautology you will be prompted
          to confirm that you wish to add that axiom to your system of lines.

          have loaded or created.  You may then begin the creation of a new 
          system of lines. 

 
          Files 
          Ctrl-F
          Get a directory 
 
          This function will display a list of files.  You are prompted 
          for the path of the directory which you would like to have 
          displayed.  If you want to simply display a directory for the 
          default path that you have selected using the ChgDir function,  
          press <ENTER> at the prompt.  The screen will be cleared and the 
          directory displayed.  If the number of files exceeds the screen 
          size use the arrow or Pg Up/Down keys to move through the list.
          Wildcard characters can be added to the path to display only
          certain files.  You can load any highlighted file by simply 
          pressing <ENTER> or press <ESC> to abort the function. 
 
 
          ChgDir 
          Ctrl-C
          Change the working directory/path 
 
          This function allows you to designate the path to be used when 
          saving or loading a file, or when taking directory.  It must 
          include everything that a path usually contains except the actual 
          file name.  Some examples of valid paths you might enter are: 
               a:\ 
               c:\logic\lines\ 
          The path must include at least the storage device letter followed
          by a colon.

          Erase 
          Erase a file 
 
          This function allows you to delete unwanted files from your 
          disk.  You will be prompted for a file name.  After you have 
          entered the full name and extension of the file you wish to 
          delete hit <ENTER>.  You will then be asked to confirm the 
          deletion process.  If you do not want to delete the file answer 
          <n> to the question "Do you want to delete this file (y/n)?"
          or hit <ESC>. 
 

          Mkdir 
          Make a directory 
 
          This function allows you to make a new directory.  You must 
          include complete path information for the new directory.  Some 
          examples are: 
               c:\logic 
               c:\logic\lines 
            

          Print 
          Ctrl-P 
          Print logical system or portion of the logical system to Disk or 
          Printer 
 
          When you select this option you will be prompted to print to disk 
          or printer.  You will then be asked for the starting line number 
          and ending line number to output.  If you simply press <ENTER> to 
          these prompts the defaults of the first and last lines will be 
          assumed and the whole system will be printed to disk or printer.  
          Otherwise only the range you have selected will be output.  You 
          will be prompted before the printing starts to press <ENTER> to 
          continue with printing or you can press <ESC> to abort the print 
          function. 
 
          Printing to "disk" creates a file which you can then edit on your 
          word processor for printing your lines in whatever manner which 
          takes best advantage of your printer.  Edit using a word processor
          of your choice.  Use a macro to speed the search and replacement of  
          delimiting characters and the placeholders for logical operators.

          Block 
          Ctrl-B 
          The highlighting function 
 
          This function key turns on the blocking feature starting at the 
          current cursor position.  You can use Ctrl-B to avoid having to 
          go through the menus.  The highlighted line will also appear in 
          the top half of the work area.  Once blocking is turned on you 
          can use Ctrl-Right Arrow to jump consecutively to the next left 
          bracket or you can simply use the Right and Left Arrow keys to 
          highlight to the right or left.  Once you have highlighted the 
          part of the line you want simply press <ENTER> or Ctrl-B to 
          finish highlighting.  The definitional transformations do not 
          require you to turn off blocking.  You need only turn blocking 
          on, highlight the desired portion of the line and press the 
          appropriate function key to perform the definitional 
          transformation.  When the transformation is complete blocking 
          will be automatically turned off for you.  When making a 
          definitional transformation make sure the right menu is showing 
          at the bottom of the screen.  Pressing <ESC> will also turn of 
          blocking. 

 
          Vroom 
          Ctrl-V 
          Jump to end of well formed formula (WFF) 
 
          If the cursor is on the beginning bracket or negation symbol of 
          any well formed formula when this function is activated the 
          cursor will jump to the end bracket of that WFF.  This function 
          is especially useful in combination with Blocking as it allows 
          one to simply position the cursor on the beginning of a WFF, hit 
          Ctrl-B and then Ctrl-V, to highlight the whole WFF.

          Search 
          Ctrl-S 
          Search for a string of characters 
 
          This option allows one to search through the entire system for 
          the occurrence of any string of variables and symbols.  You are 
          asked first to enter the string you want to search for.  You are 
          then asked what kind of search you would like performed.  There 
          are three kinds of search.  One can search for any whole line that 
          matches the search string by choosing [1] "Line Match", any
          line containing the search string by choosing [2] "Where used", or 
          any line matching the pattern of the variables of the search string
          by choosing [3] "Form".  For example, searching for the string 
          (p>p) by "form" will also find (q>q) and (r>r).  Lines which contain
          or match the search string will have their line numbers listed in
          the work area.  You can use the jump function to jump to these
          numbers consecutively by simply selecting the Jump option and then 
          hitting <ENTER> when prompted for the line number. 
 
 
          Delete 
          Ctrl-D 
          Deletes a line 
 
          This feature will delete the line on which the cursor is 
          currently placed.  It will then renumber any following lines and 
          proofs so that they represent the new line and proof numbers.  If 
          any lines have the deleted line as one of their justifications, 
          those lines will also be deleted. 

 
          Occamize 
          Remove all lines which do not contribute to proving a theorem 
 
          This option allows one to select a line for "occamization" and 
          then deletes all the lines from the system which do not 
          contribute to proving that line.  It is a dangerous function 
          which once activated starts deleting useless lines.  Be careful 
          with its use!  It is for this reason that before the process 
          starts you are asked to confirm your selection.  If you want to 
          continue with the function press <ENTER>, otherwise press <ESC> 
          to abort.  Once all the lines are deleted, the system is 
          renumbered to represent an accurate proof of the line you 
          selected.  You select a line by moving the cursor to it before 
          selecting the function.

          Mem 
          Display amount of free memory left for lines
 
          This function gives a rough idea of how much memory you have left
          for entering lines.  Just remember that the number represents
          total string memory left for program use.  The program must
          reserve about 1500 bytes for its own use.  The rest is available
          for your system.  When the number drops below 1500 you will no
          longer be allowed to add lines and will be prompted to save your
          system to disk.  The program will terminate operations.  Exit and
          restart Logical Theorist to refresh the memory space.

 
          Store 
          Save default paramters to disk 

          This function stores your current parameters, logical values and
          system filename in a file "logic53.pin."  This file is loaded at
          startup.  Delete "logic53.pin" if you encounter any problems
          starting Logical Theorist 5.3 or if you wish to return to the
          original program defaults.
 
          Param 
          Input various parameters 
 
          This function pops up a little menu in which you can enter values 
          for screen colours and print parameters.  Press <ENTER> to accept 
          displayed default values.  Continue to pressing <ENTER> to the 
          end of the list to complete the function. 

          The printer setup string can consist of a sequence of 2 digit
          hexadecimal numbers, such as "1B0D".  Single digit numbers must
          contain a leading zero, as in the case of the "0D" (ASCII 
          code 13, or carriage return) in the example. "1B" = ASC code 27.

 
                                Additional functions 
 
          Letter Keys (a-z) 
 
          When the cursor is on top of any lowercase letter in the Lines 
          Screen pressing a letter key will allow one to swap that letter 
          with the letter pressed.

          Every time you select this option you will cycle to the next 
          display option.  The following is a list of the three display 
          options: 
               1 - Full screen of lines. 
               2 - Full screen of proofs.

          Jump 
          Ctrl-J 
          Jump to a specific line number 

          Selecting this option will allow you to move the cursor to a 
          specific line number.  You will be prompted for a line number  
          which can be up to three digits in length.  The lines screen 
          will change to the section of the system you want with the cursor 
          resting on the line you selected.  If you have done a search 
          which turns up a series of lines containing your search string
          then you can jump consecutively to these lines simply by 
          selecting Jump and then hitting <ENTER>.  Each time you do this, 
          you will be taken to each line number in the "lines found" list. 
          After jumping to the last line you will be cycled back to the first
          line in the list.  After creating a new line, choosing Jump and
          hitting enter will take you to that line.
