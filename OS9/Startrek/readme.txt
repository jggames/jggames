              Jim's OS9 Level II Games


This is a port to basic09 from the DEC PDP 11.
You will need the basic09 modules gfx2,syscall,
and inkey available in your cmds directory in
order to run these games. 

The source file is incomplete. It has somehow 
become corrupted over the years...

Too see the game, run the Basic09 runtime 
version.

It might need you to turn off keyboard echo,
using tmode...
