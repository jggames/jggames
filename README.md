My TRS-80 Colour Computer and Micro Color Computer Games and other software

The RSDOS directory contains Color Basic programs for the TRS-80 Color Computer.  In general the definitive versions of all these programs can be found
on my most recent release of my JGGAMES.zip containing various .dsk files for use on the VCC Coco emulator.

The OS9 directory contains Basic09 and C source files for the OS9 operating system. There are programs for the Level 1 and Level 2 versions of that OS.
For the Level 1 programs you will need to run them on a Coco 1/2 or Coco 1/2 emulator or you will have to set up a 32 X 16 VDG screen on your Coco 3 running OS9 Level 2.
For the Level 2 programs you will generally need an 80 X 24 Text Window open. Some of the programs use the graphics libraries GFX (for Level 1) or GFX2 (for Level 2).
You will sometimes need to load other additional routines like INKEY, or TMODE...
